Description: Provides an 'htmlwidgets' interface to the
    'MetricsGraphics.js' ('D3'-based) charting library which is geared towards
    displaying time-series data. Chart types include line charts, scatterplots,
    histograms and rudimentary bar charts. Support for laying out mutiple charts
    into a grid layout is also provided. All charts are interactive and many
    have an option for line, label and region annotations.
